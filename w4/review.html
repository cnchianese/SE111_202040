                <p><em>My Cousin Vinny</em> is a fantastic movie for a couple different reasons. There are some great actors that were casted for the movie. Personally I cant see anyone else in the roles that they had. The chemistry between the actors and the comedy throughout keeps you enganged. My father first showed it to me when I was younger as it is one of his favorite movies of all time.</p>
                <p>The main character Vinny is played by Joe Pesci. He does a great job having the proper mannerism of a New Yorker. Marisa Tomei even won an oscar for best supporting actress. These are the main actors but all the rest did a very good job as well. The movie has been out for a while but that doesn't change the fact that it is up to todays standard in movies. </p>

                    <h3>Trivia</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When Vinny is trying to explain his "real name" to Judge Haller he knocks over the judge's chess board. This was accidental but director Jonathan Lynn thought it was so funny and authentic he decided to leave it in the film.</li>
                        <li>Joe Pesci was 49, while Marisa Tomei was 27 when this movie was released.</li>
                        <li>The quote "dead-on balls accurate" is a reference to an actual attorney named Joey Callo, from whom the name Jerry Callow/Gallow was borrowed.</li>
