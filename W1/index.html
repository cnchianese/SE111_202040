        <h1>Connor Chianese</h1>
        <p>My name is <b>Connor Chianese</b> and I am an <u>18 year old</u> college student. I spend the majority of my time playing video games and listening to music. I have lived in Connecticut for most of my life. Before that I had to move around a couple times from my father being in the Navy. I am looking to get into the <i>cybersecurity</i> field and hope I do well. I am not very good at coming up with information to fill in space. A lot of times I will start to mention how I am not good so it will fill up more room.</p>
